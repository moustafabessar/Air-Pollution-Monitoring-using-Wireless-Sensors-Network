# Air-Pollution-Monitoring-using-Wireless-Sensors-Network
This is my graduation project (demo version), Currently I am working on releasing the stable version of my project
I used Atmega32 for Salve nodes, Arduino Mega for Master node (Gateway).
I wrote this code 3 years ago, now I'm re-designing the whole project to add some features like RTOS, Low power Modes, Enhancing communication reliability between nodes and enhancing gas sensor drivers

See the schematic for slave node to understand the code.
